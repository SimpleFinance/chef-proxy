# Chef Proxy cookbook

A cookbook for managing /etc/hosts. Wraps around the Opscode HAproxy
cookbook (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/haproxy)

## Use cases

We use this cookbook to trick service instances into sending traffic meant for external
/ third-party services through a proxy instance we control. The proxy instance
runs HAproxy, while the service instances have their /etc/hosts modified
to route endpoint traffic towards this proxy. This lets us more easily manage egress traffic.

## Recipes

#### Default
Calls the `Server` recipe

#### Server
Configures an instance to route traffic via HAproxy

#### Client
Configures an instance to send traffic destined for a host to go through a
proxy instance via the `node[:proxy][:host]` attribute.

#### Monitoring
This recipe sets up Sensu checks for each data bag item (and thus, each
client). This obviously requires Sensu, which we use, but the recipe provides a cheap
way of shipping monitoring using already-defined data.

## Resources

#### proxy\_host
This resource creates, modifies, or deletes an /etc/hosts entry using either
the :create (default) or :delete action. Includes the following parameters:

* `remote_host` : the endpoint of the traffic (name attribute)
* `ipaddr` : IP address to proxy the traffic through (optional)
* `comment` : Comment for extra information appended to the entry (optional)
* `action` : One of :create (default) or :delete
